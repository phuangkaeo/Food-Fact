# Context of the project
You join FoodFlix, a FoodTech startup that is currently working on an application to recommend the best product to a user according to a keyword or a set of keywords. The elements to be reassembled are the elements linked to the Nutri Score for the MVP. However, you can be proactive and propose new elements.

As an AI developer, you have been commissioned to prove that the data collected will allow this future application to be set up.

Your work will consist in studying the data, selecting the subset that will allow the solution to be implemented and to propose a good quality data set allowing to move on to the implementation of the recommendation engine (This part will be developed in a other Brief - Content-based Recommendation Engine).

Don't forget to make a plan + the project management part. These parts should be included in the report. Export of the schedule and Explanation + visualization of your Trello. This plan must contain the main stages of your project: project management, development of deliverable 1, development of deliverable 2, creation of slides. It is preferable to make the slides of the presentation as you go.

To facilitate your work, you will work on part of the dataset first (eg: 10,000 lines), then you will use more data as soon as your code is valid.
